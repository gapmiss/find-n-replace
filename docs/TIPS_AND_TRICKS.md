## Performance Optimization

### Optimize for Large Vaults (>5000 files)

**Problem:** Searches slow down or UI freezes in large vaults

**Solutions:**

#### 1. Strategic File Filtering

**Always** use file filtering when possible:

```
files to include: .md              â†’ Only markdown files
files to include: .js, .ts         â†’ Only JavaScript/TypeScript files
files to include: Daily/, Projects/ â†’ Only specific folders
files to exclude: Archive/, Attachments/ â†’ Skip large folders
```

**Performance Impact:**
- No filtering: 10,000 files scanned (8-10 seconds)
- With filtering: 2,000 files scanned (1-2 seconds)
- **5-10x faster** with proper filters

**Pro Tip:** Create filter presets in settings for common use cases:
- Daily notes only: `Daily/`
- Current work: `Projects/, Work/`
- No archives: Exclude `Archive/, Old/, Backup/`

- Show: Side-by-side comparison of search times with/without filtering
- Annotation: Performance metrics showing time difference
- Highlight: Filter panel with optimized patterns

#### 2. Reduce Max Results

Settings â†’ Core settings â†’ Max Results

**Recommended Values:**
- Small vaults (<1000 files): 1000-2000 (default)
- Medium vaults (1000-5000 files): 500-1000
- Large vaults (>5000 files): 200-500

**Why it matters:**
- Fewer results = faster rendering
- UI remains responsive
- Memory usage reduced

**Trade-off:** May truncate results, but notification shows when limit reached

#### 3. Increase Debounce Delay

Settings â†’ Core settings â†’ Search Debounce Delay

**Recommended Values:**
- Fast typer: 500ms
- Default: 300ms
- Heavy vault: 700-1000ms

**Effect:**
- Longer delay = fewer searches triggered while typing
- Reduces unnecessary searches on partial input
- Balances responsiveness with performance

#### 4. Disable Auto-Search for Complex Patterns

Settings â†’ Core settings â†’ Enable Auto Search: OFF

**When to disable:**
- Working with complex regex patterns
- Very large vaults
- Want full control over when search executes

**Workflow:**
- Type complete pattern
- Press Enter to execute search manually
- Prevents intermediate searches on partial patterns

#### 5. Use Specific Regex Patterns

**Slow:**
```
.*                    â†’ Matches everything (greedy)
[\s\S]*              â†’ Matches all characters including newlines
(.+)+                â†’ Catastrophic backtracking
```

**Fast:**
```
\bspecific\b         â†’ Exact word match
\.md$                â†’ Specific file extension
#[a-z0-9-]+          â†’ Constrained character class
```

**Performance Tips:**
- Avoid greedy quantifiers (`.*`, `.+`) when possible
- Use specific character classes instead of `.`
- Anchor patterns with `^` or `\b` for faster matching
- Test patterns on single file first

## Keyboard Shortcuts Mastery

### Essential Hotkey Setup

Configure these hotkeys in Obsidian Settings â†’ Hotkeys â†’ Find-n-Replace:

**Recommended Configuration:**

| Command | Recommended Hotkey | Why |
|---------|-------------------|-----|
| Open Find-n-Replace | `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+F` | Matches VSCode convention |
| Focus Search Input | `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+H` | Quick access to search |
| Focus Replace Input | `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R` | Jump to replace field |
| Toggle Match Case | `Alt+C` | Quick toggle while searching |
| Toggle Whole Word | `Alt+W` | Quick toggle while searching |
| Toggle Regex | `Alt+R` | Enable/disable regex quickly |
| Select All Results | `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+A` | Select all for bulk operations |
| Replace Selected | `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+E` | Execute selected replacements |

**Pro Tip:** Use consistent modifiers:
- `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift` for main actions
- `Alt` for toggles
- Avoids conflicts with Obsidian core hotkeys

**ðŸ“¸ Screenshot Placeholder:** `tips-03-keyboard-hotkeys.png`
- Show: Hotkey settings panel with recommended configuration
- Annotation: Purpose of each hotkey assignment
- Highlight: Conflict-free modifier combinations

### Rapid Workflow Shortcuts

**Speed Workflow for Repetitive Tasks:**

1. **Open plugin:** `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+F`
2. **Type search:** (auto-search starts)
3. **Press Enter:** Save to history
4. **Tab to replace:** Moves focus to replace input
5. **Type replacement:** Preview updates automatically
6. **Select all:** `Ctrl/Cmd+A` (or `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+A` with hotkey)
7. **Replace:** Click "Replace Selected" or use hotkey
8. **Clear and restart:** `Escape` in search field â†’ type new search

**Total time:** ~10-15 seconds per search-replace cycle

### Navigation Shortcuts

**Sequential Tab Navigation:**

```
Tab â†’ Search input
Tab â†’ Replace input
Tab â†’ Match Case toggle
Tab â†’ Whole Word toggle
Tab â†’ Regex toggle
Tab â†’ Multiline toggle
Tab â†’ Filter button
Tab â†’ Toolbar actions
Tab â†’ Results container
Tab â†’ First file header
Tab â†’ First result
Tab â†’ Replace button
(continues through all results)
```

**Pro Tips:**
- `Shift+Tab` to navigate backward
- `Enter`/`Space` to activate focused element
- `Escape` to clear selections or inputs
- Tab order optimized for efficient keyboard-only usage

### History Navigation Power User

**Building a Pattern Library:**

1. **Save patterns as you create them:** Press Enter after typing
2. **Navigate history:** `â†‘`/`â†“` arrows in input field
3. **Increase history capacity:** Settings â†’ Max History Entries: 200
4. **Organize patterns:** Keep most-used patterns at top (most recent)

**Advanced History Technique:**

"Refresh" important patterns by re-saving them:
1. Navigate to old pattern with `â†‘`
2. Make tiny edit (add/remove space)
3. Edit back to original
4. Press Enter
5. Pattern moves to top of history (most recent)

**Use Case:** Keep frequently-used regex patterns accessible without scrolling through history

## Advanced Regex Techniques

### Lookaheads and Lookbehinds

**Positive Lookahead** `(?=...)`
- Matches position where pattern follows

**Example: Find "test" only when followed by "file"**
```
Search: test(?=file)
Matches: "test" in "testfile"
Does not match: "test" in "testing"
```

**Negative Lookahead** `(?!...)`
- Matches position where pattern does NOT follow

**Example: Find "log" not followed by "in"**
```
Search: log(?!in)
Matches: "log" in "logger", "logging"
Does not match: "log" in "login"
```

**Positive Lookbehind** `(?<=...)`
- Matches position where pattern precedes

**Example: Find "log" only after "event"**
```
Search: (?<=event)log
Matches: "log" in "eventlog"
Does not match: "log" in "changelog"
```

**Negative Lookbehind** `(?<!...)`
- Matches position where pattern does NOT precede

**Example: Find "#tag" not in URL (avoid #anchor)**
```
Search: (?<!http)(?<!https)#([a-z0-9-]+)
Matches: "#projectname" (inline tag)
Does not match: "https://example.com#section"
```

**ðŸ“¸ Screenshot Placeholder:** `tips-04-advanced-regex-lookaround.png`
- Show: Examples of lookahead/lookbehind with matches/non-matches
- Annotation: Explanation of each lookaround type
- Highlight: Patterns with positive/negative lookaround differences

### Non-Capturing Groups

**Syntax:** `(?:...)`

**Use Case:** Grouping without creating capture reference

**Example: Match variations without capture overhead**
```
Search: (?:TODO|FIXME|HACK):\s*(.+)
Replace: - [ ] $1

Only one capture group ($1), but matches all three keywords
```

**Why use non-capturing groups?**
- Improves performance (fewer captures to track)
- Simplifies replacement numbering
- Still provides grouping for quantifiers

**Example: Repeating patterns**
```
Search: (?:ha)+
Matches: "ha", "haha", "hahaha"
No capture groups created
```

### Greedy vs. Lazy Quantifiers

**Greedy** (default): Matches as much as possible
- `.*` â†’ Matches everything to end of line
- `.+` â†’ Matches one or more (maximum)

**Lazy** (add `?`): Matches as little as possible
- `.*?` â†’ Matches minimum until next pattern
- `.+?` â†’ Matches one or more (minimum)

**Example: Extract text between brackets**

**Greedy:**
```
Search: \[(.+)\]
Text: "[first] and [second]"
Matches: "first] and [second" (everything between first [ and last ])
```

**Lazy:**
```
Search: \[(.+?)\]
Text: "[first] and [second]"
Matches: "first" (stops at first ]), then "second" (separate matches)
```

**Use lazy when:** You want minimal matching, especially with multiple instances

### Character Class Shortcuts

**Built-in Classes:**
- `\d` â†’ Digit [0-9]
- `\D` â†’ Non-digit [^0-9]
- `\w` â†’ Word character [a-zA-Z0-9_]
- `\W` â†’ Non-word character [^a-zA-Z0-9_]
- `\s` â†’ Whitespace [ \t\n\r]
- `\S` â†’ Non-whitespace [^ \t\n\r]

**Custom Classes:**
- `[a-z]` â†’ Lowercase letters
- `[A-Z]` â†’ Uppercase letters
- `[a-zA-Z]` â†’ All letters
- `[0-9]` â†’ Digits
- `[a-z0-9-]` â†’ Lowercase, digits, hyphens

**Negated Classes:**
- `[^abc]` â†’ Anything except a, b, or c
- `[^\]]` â†’ Anything except closing bracket

**Pro Tip:** Use `\w` instead of `[a-zA-Z0-9_]` for readability

## Selection Management

### Strategic Multi-Selection

**Keyboard Selection:**
- `Ctrl/Cmd+A` â†’ Select all visible results
- `Ctrl/Cmd+Click` â†’ Toggle individual result
- `Escape` â†’ Clear all selections

**Mouse Selection:**
- Click checkbox icon (if visible)
- Ctrl/Cmd+Click on result snippet
- Purple gradient indicates selection

### Selection Patterns

**Pattern 1: Select All, Deselect Exceptions**

Best for: Bulk operations with few exceptions

1. `Ctrl/Cmd+A` to select all
2. `Ctrl/Cmd+Click` to deselect specific unwanted matches
3. Execute "Replace Selected"

**Pattern 2: Select Specific, Build Up**

Best for: Careful, surgical replacements

1. Start with no selection
2. `Ctrl/Cmd+Click` to select each valid match
3. Selection count updates in toolbar
4. Execute "Replace Selected"

**Pattern 3: File-by-File Selection**

Best for: File-specific decisions

1. Expand first file group
2. Review all matches in context
3. Select matches to replace in that file
4. Use file header menu â†’ "Replace All in File"
5. Move to next file

**ðŸ“¸ Screenshot Placeholder:** `tips-05-selection-patterns.png`
- Show: Visual workflow for each selection pattern
- Annotation: When to use each pattern
- Highlight: Selection states and counts

### Selection Persistence

**Key Feature:** Selections maintain state when editing replacement text

**Workflow:**
1. Select specific matches: `Ctrl/Cmd+Click` (e.g., 15 selected)
2. Type replacement text â†’ Preview updates
3. Edit replacement â†’ Selections persist (still 15 selected)
4. Refine until perfect â†’ Execute "Replace Selected"

**Why it matters:**
- No need to re-select after editing
- Iterate on replacement pattern without losing selections
- Build confidence before executing

**Pro Tip:** Use selection persistence to experiment with different replacement patterns on same set of matches

## Search History Power User

### Building a Pattern Library

**Strategy 1: Curate Your History**

- **Save only refined patterns:** Don't save typos or experimental patterns
- **Re-save important patterns:** Moves them to top of history (most recent)
- **Clear periodically:** Settings â†’ Clear All History when cluttered

**Strategy 2: Document Complex Patterns**

Create vault note: `Templates/Regex Patterns.md`

```markdown
# Reusable Regex Patterns

## Date Formats
- ISO to US: `(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})` â†’ `$2/$3/$1`
- European to US: `(\d{2})/(\d{2})/(\d{4})` â†’ `$2/$1/$3`

## Links
- External links: `\[([^\]]+)\]\((https?://[^)]+)\)`
- Wikilinks with aliases: `\[\[([^\]|]+)\|([^\]]+)\]\]`

## Tags
- Inline hashtags: `#([a-z0-9-]+)`
- Convert to wikilinks: Replace with `[[tags/$1]]`

## Tasks
- Standardize format: `^[-*]\s*\[\s*\]\s*(.+)$` â†’ `- [ ] $1`
```

**Benefits:**
- Searchable pattern library
- Team can share patterns
- Patterns versioned with vault (Git)

**ðŸ“¸ Screenshot Placeholder:** `tips-06-pattern-library.png`
- Show: Example pattern library note with organized regex patterns
- Annotation: Categories and reusable patterns
- Highlight: Copy-paste ready patterns with explanations

### History Navigation Shortcuts

**Quick History Access:**

1. **Focus input:** Click or use hotkey
2. **Instantly navigate:** Press `â†‘` (no need to clear input first)
3. **Cycle through:** `â†‘`/`â†“` to browse
4. **Select pattern:** Press `Enter` to search and re-save
5. **Exit history:** Press `Escape` to restore typed input

**Pro Tips:**
- **Don't type full pattern first:** Navigate history immediately
- **Edit historical patterns:** Modify after navigating, press Enter to save variant
- **History is per-input:** Search history and replace history are separate

## File Filtering Strategies

### Filter Presets via Settings

**Strategy:** Configure default filters in settings for common scenarios

**Scenario 1: Daily Notes Only**
```
Settings â†’ Default files to include: Daily/
Settings â†’ Default files to exclude: (empty)
```

**Scenario 2: Current Work (No Archives)**
```
Settings â†’ Default files to include: Projects/, Work/
Settings â†’ Default files to exclude: Archive/, Old/, Completed/
```

**Scenario 3: Markdown Only (No Code)**
```
Settings â†’ Default files to include: .md
Settings â†’ Default files to exclude: *.js, *.ts, *.json
```

**Scenario 4: Code Files Only (No Markdown)**
```
Settings â†’ Default files to include: .js, .ts, .css, .json
Settings â†’ Default files to exclude: .md, .txt
```

**Workflow:**
- Configure defaults in settings
- Open plugin â†’ Filters auto-populated
- Make session-only adjustments as needed
- Close/reopen to reload defaults

### Glob Pattern Mastery

**Basic Patterns:**
- `*.md` â†’ All markdown files (any directory)
- `.md` â†’ Files ending with .md (equivalent to *.md)
- `folder/` â†’ All files in folder directory

**Advanced Patterns:**
- `**/*.md` â†’ All markdown files in all subdirectories recursively
- `Projects/**/*.txt` â†’ Text files in Projects and all subfolders
- `*backup*` â†’ Any file with "backup" anywhere in name
- `temp/*` â†’ All files directly in temp folder (not subdirectories)

**Combining Patterns:**
```
files to include: .md, .txt, Notes/
(Matches markdown OR text files OR anything in Notes/)

files to exclude: Archive/, *.tmp, *backup*
(Excludes Archive folder OR temp files OR backup files)
```

**ðŸ“¸ Screenshot Placeholder:** `tips-07-glob-patterns.png`
- Show: Filter panel with complex glob patterns and visual explanation
- Annotation: Pattern syntax breakdown with match examples
- Highlight: Differences between *.ext, folder/, and **/ patterns

### Dynamic Filtering Workflow

**Use Case:** Need different filters for different searches in same session

**Workflow:**
1. Open plugin with default filters
2. Perform first search with defaults
3. Modify filters for specific search (session-only)
4. Perform second search with new filters
5. Adjust filters again for third search
6. Close plugin when done (resets to defaults)

**Example Session:**
- Search 1: Find TODOs in project notes (filter: `Projects/`)
- Search 2: Find broken links in all notes (clear filters)
- Search 3: Update dates in daily notes only (filter: `Daily/`)

**Pro Tip:** Filters are session-only, so experiment freely without changing settings

## Clear Input Button Efficiency

### One-Click Input Clearing

**Feature:** All text inputs have contextual X buttons

**Inputs with Clear Buttons:**
- Search input
- Replace input
- Files to include input
- Files to exclude input

**Behavior:**
- Appears when content present
- Disappears when empty
- Click X or press Escape to clear
- Focus remains in input after clearing

### Clear Button Workflows

**Workflow 1: Quick Iteration**

1. Enter search pattern â†’ Results appear
2. Review results
3. Click X to clear search
4. Type new pattern immediately (focus preserved)
5. Repeat for multiple searches

**Workflow 2: Filter Experimentation**

1. Set include filter â†’ Search
2. Results too limited
3. Click X on include filter
4. Try exclude filter instead
5. Click X to clear if needed
6. Iterate until optimal results

**Workflow 3: History + Clear**

1. Navigate history with `â†‘`/`â†“`
2. Historical pattern appears
3. Not what you wanted
4. Press Escape to clear and restore your typed input
5. (Or press Escape again to clear entirely)

**Pro Tip:** Combine clear buttons with search history for rapid pattern testing

**ðŸ“¸ Screenshot Placeholder:** `tips-08-clear-buttons.png`
- Show: Close-up of clear buttons on various inputs with visible/hidden states
- Annotation: Workflow showing rapid clearing and re-entering
- Highlight: Focus retention after clear action

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Forgetting Escape Characters

**Problem:**
```
Search: .md
Intended: Find ".md" file extension
Actual: Matches "cmd", "amd", "zmd" (. matches any character)
```

**Solution:**
```
Search: \.md
(Escape the period with backslash)
```

**Common Characters to Escape:**
```
. * + ? [ ] ( ) { } | ^ $ \
Use: \. \* \+ \? \[ etc.
```

### Pitfall 2: Greedy Quantifier Overreach

**Problem:**
```
Search: \[(.+)\]
Text: "[first] and [second]"
Matches: "first] and [second" (everything between first [ and last ])
```

**Solution:**
```
Search: \[(.+?)\]
(Use lazy quantifier .+?)
Matches: "first" and "second" separately
```

### Pitfall 3: Missing Multiline Mode

**Problem:**
```
Search: ^## Heading
Text has headings, but returns 0 results
```

**Solution:**
Enable Multiline toggle (â¤“) for `^` and `$` anchors to work

**Rule:** If using `^`, `$`, or `\n` in pattern, enable Multiline mode

### Pitfall 4: Replace All Without Preview

**Problem:**
Execute "Replace All in Vault" without reviewing preview

**Solution:**
1. **Always review preview** before replacing (red strikethrough â†’ green)
2. **Test on single match** first (hover â†’ "Replace This")
3. **Enable confirmation modal:** Settings â†’ Confirm Destructive Actions: ON
4. **Use file-by-file** for unfamiliar patterns

### Pitfall 5: Ignoring Filter Active State

**Problem:**
Search returns unexpectedly few results because filters are still active from previous search

**Solution:**
- **Check filter button** for active indicator (badge/border)
- **Clear filters** when switching to different search scope
- **Be aware:** Filters persist during session
- Click filter button to review/clear active filters

### Pitfall 6: Forgetting Capture Group Numbering

**Problem:**
```
Search: (\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})
Replace: $0/$1/$2
Expects: Year/Month/Day
Actual: ERROR or unexpected result ($0 is not a valid capture reference)
```

**Solution:**
Capture groups are 1-indexed: `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc.
```
Replace: $1/$2/$3
```

**Note:** `$0` is not standard (use `$&` for entire match instead)

### Pitfall 7: Not Testing Regex Before Bulk Replace

**Problem:**
Run "Replace All in Vault" with untested regex pattern, causing widespread incorrect replacements

**Solution: Always Test First**

1. **Test on regex101.com** with sample text
2. **Search in single file** first (use file filtering)
3. **Review all preview results** thoroughly
4. **Replace single match** to verify behavior
5. **Scale gradually:** Single file â†’ Folder â†’ Vault

**Rule:** Never skip testing phase for complex patterns
