# Find-n-Replace

A vault-wide **search and replace** plugin for Obsidian. Find-n-Replace helps you locate content across your entire vault through powerful search operations, then replace matches efficiently with regex support, multi-selection capabilities, file filtering, and real-time preview.

## What This Plugin Does

**Find-n-Replace** provides a dedicated search interface that helps you find and modify content across your vault. The plugin allows you to:

1. **Filter and search** across your entire vault with file type and folder controls
2. **Preview all matches** in a structured, navigable list
3. **Select specific matches** or entire files for replacement
4. **Execute replacements** with full regex capture group support
5. **Navigate directly** to any match location with a single click
6. **Optimize performance** by limiting search scope to relevant files and folders

Unlike Obsidian's built-in search, Find-n-Replace is designed specifically for bulk editing operations across multiple files simultaneously, combining the discovery power of search with precise replacement capabilities.

> [!CAUTION]
> **This plugin directly modifies your vault files!** All replace operations permanently change file contents. While the plugin includes safety features and error handling, **you are responsible for maintaining backups of your vault**. Always ensure you have a recent backup before performing bulk replacements, especially when using regex patterns or vault-wide operations. Consider using Git version control or Obsidian's built-in sync/backup features to protect your data.

## Core Features

### Search Capabilities
- **Full-text search** across all text files in your vault (markdown, txt, js, css, json, and more)
- **Universal file type support** - works with any text-based file format by default

6. Click any result to navigate to that location in your vault

### üí° Quick How-To: Searching Different File Types

**By default, the plugin searches ALL text files** (not just markdown). To search specific file types:

**Search code files only:**
1. Click the üîç filter button
2. In "files to include": type `.js, .ts, .css`
3. Search for your pattern (e.g., `console\.log`)

**Search config files only:**
1. Click the üîç filter button
2. In "files to include": type `.json, .yaml, .xml`
3. Search for your pattern (e.g., `"version"`)

**Exclude non-markdown files:**
1. Click the üîç filter button
2. In "files to exclude": type `*.js, *.json, *.css`
3. Now only markdown and text files will be searched

**Pro tip:** Leave filters empty to search all file types at once!

### VSCode-Style File Filtering (Performance Optimization)
Click the **üîç** filter button to open the expandable filter panel with clear-input enabled fields:

**files to include Examples:**
- `.md, .txt` - Only search markdown and text files
- `.js, .css, .json` - Only search JavaScript, CSS, and JSON files
- `Notes/, Daily/` - Only search in Notes and Daily folders
- `.md, Projects/` - Only markdown files in Projects folder
- Use the X button to quickly clear include patterns

**files to exclude Examples:**
- `*.tmp, *backup*` - Skip temporary and backup files
- `Archive/, Templates/` - Skip Archive and Templates folders
- `temp/*, *.log` - Skip temp folder and log files
- Use the X button to quickly clear exclude patterns

**Session-Only Behavior:**
- Filter changes are temporary and don't modify plugin settings
- Settings provide default values when opening the view
- Close and reopen the view to load fresh defaults

### Search Options
- **Match Case**: Enable case-sensitive searching
- **Whole Word**: Match complete words only (adds word boundaries)
- **Use Regex**: Enable regular expression pattern matching
- **Multiline**: Enable cross-line regex patterns (requires Regex mode)

### Multi-Selection
- **Ctrl/Cmd+Click**: Toggle selection of individual results
- **Ctrl/Cmd+A**: Select all visible results
- **Escape**: Clear all selections

### Replacement Options
- **Replace This**: Replace a single match (appears on hover)
- **Replace Selected**: Replace all currently selected matches
- **Replace All in File**: Replace all matches within a specific file
- **Replace All in Vault**: Replace all matches across entire vault

### File Group Management
- Click file names to expand/collapse result groups
- File states persist across search sessions
- Expand/Collapse All button in toolbar for bulk operations

## Configuration

### Plugin Settings

#### Search history
- **Enable Search History**: Toggle history feature on/off (default: enabled)
- **Maximum History Entries**: Number of patterns to remember, 10-200 (default: 50)
- **Clear All History**: Button to clear all saved search and replace patterns

#### Core settings
- **Max Results**: Maximum search results to display (default: 1000)
- **Search Debounce Delay**: Delay before auto-search triggers (default: 300ms)
- **Enable Auto Search**: Toggle automatic search-as-you-type. When disabled, press Enter to search

#### User experience
- **Confirm Destructive Actions**: Show confirmation modal before Replace All operations (default: enabled)
- **Remember Search Options**: Persist Match Case, Whole Word, Regex, and Multiline toggle states across sessions (default: disabled)

#### Troubleshooting
- **Console Logging Level**: Granular control over console output (Silent, Errors Only, Standard, Verbose, Debug, Trace)

### File Filtering (VSCode-Style Defaults)
- **Default files to include**: Default patterns for "files to include" input (examples: `.md,.txt`, `Notes/,Projects/`, `*.js`)
- **Default files to exclude**: Default patterns for "files to exclude" input (examples: `*.tmp,*backup*`, `Archive/,Templates/`)

**How Default Filters Work:**
- Settings populate the filter inputs when opening the Find-n-Replace view
- Filter inputs are session-only and don't modify these default settings
- To apply new defaults: change settings above, then close and reopen the view
- Leave settings empty to start with no filters by default
