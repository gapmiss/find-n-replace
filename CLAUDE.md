### Key Components

#### 1. **SearchEngine** (`src/core/searchEngine.ts`)
- Performs vault-wide search operations with regex compilation and caching
- Batch processing (10 files) to maintain UI responsiveness
- File filtering with extensions, folders, and glob patterns
- Graceful error handling for file read failures

#### 2. **ReplacementEngine** (`src/core/replacementEngine.ts`)
- Handles all file modification operations with atomic file operations
- **CRITICAL:** Contains infinite loop protection for zero-length regex matches
- Regex replacement expansion with capture groups ($1, $&, etc.)
- Security: Timeout protection against ReDoS attacks (5-second limit)

#### 3. **FindReplaceView** (`src/ui/views/findReplaceView.ts`)
- Main plugin interface extending Obsidian's ItemView
- VSCode-style search and replace UI with real-time result rendering
- Search cancellation with AbortController and debounced auto-search
- Comprehensive error boundaries for all async operations

#### 4. **SearchToolbar** (`src/ui/components/searchToolbar.ts`)
- Creates all UI elements (search input, replace input, toggle buttons, adaptive toolbar)
- **Clear-input buttons** for all text inputs with contextual visibility
- **VSCode-style expandable filter panel** with "files to include" / "files to exclude" inputs
- **Session-only filter management** - filters don't modify settings; settings provide defaults
- Complete keyboard navigation and accessibility support including filter panel
